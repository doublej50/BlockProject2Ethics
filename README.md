# BlockProject2Ethics
This is a small program that checks the strength of a password for an ethics assignment. 
This program checks the strength of a password by deteriming 6 total things. 
If the password is longer than 8 characters, if it contains upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, and special characters (divided into two, punctuation and symbols)
The program was developed on visual studio and should run easily with that or any correctly formatted command line argument. 
It contains dependances to .NET and related Microsoft libraries.
It takes in the password you input and then tells you the strength, after it will ask you if you want to keep going or stop.
# This program is not overly robust. It only checks for the listed factors. It does not guarantee a strong password or a weak password. The limitations that were placed are arbitrary and do not have any resources backing them.
This program is a great starting point for a password. I highly recommend using a second password checker to check the strength of your password.

# Ethical considerations
This code could be easily modified to present security risks to those that enter their passwords. Make sure they don't remove the strength factors or store any passwords.
Once again, this password checker is not overly robust, it checks a few main points. Do not believe that you password is strong solely because this software says so.
